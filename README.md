# Marine Debris Project

My interest in researching and addressing waste issues in Jeju Island's ports was sparked by a personal experience that left a lasting impact. A friend and I decided to travel to Moseulpo Port, the closest one to my school, to escape from academics. Our excitement, however, quickly turned to disappointment as we approached a lighthouse surrounded by numerous fishing boats. Instead of the beautiful beach we had expected, we were greeted by a noxious odor emanating from the ocean waters and a distressing sight â€“ an overwhelming amount of debris floating on the surface. It appeared as though this trash had accumulated at a specific point due to the shifting tides, and it included items such as ramen wrappers, bottles, plastic nets, and more.

As residents of Jeju, this stark contrast to our expectations prompted me to take action. Together with my uncle, I founded a voluntary group called 'hiros.' After each gathering at the port, we diligently cleaned up most of the visible trash. However, the disheartening part was that every time we returned, the areas we had cleared were once again inundated with new debris. This perpetual cycle left us pondering the root causes of this pollution and its sources, igniting a passion within us to research and find solutions for the sake of our beloved Jeju Island.
